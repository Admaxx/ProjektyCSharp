This is a example of Warehouse's system for paper store
Added operations: 
Creating new items, Reading already added items, Updating and Deleting (CRUD) - all by store staff.
Companies list from who importing avaible items,
View for item details

TODO:
-Login/registration page,
-Companies list from who importing avaible items - code optimalization needed,
-CheckBox for many updates,
-Getting code to seperated classes and set "light" controllers
No new ideas, maybe soon...



Everything is in Polish lang.
